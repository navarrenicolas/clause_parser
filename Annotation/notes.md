## Interesting sentences:

- He says it wasnâ€™t until Mayor Lyn Hall was elected that the wheels were set in motion.

## First Pass

- Filtered based on SBAR presence (<500/10000)

- Opening the data on excel to annotate has proven difficult.
    - Issues with character import
    - Will try to edit the pandas dataFrame directly to save in that format later

## Second Pass

- Annotation tool with keyboard input successful
TODO:
- Save full data with annotated and not-annotated data if quit at any point
- Make the presentation of sentences nicer
