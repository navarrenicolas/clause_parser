297,"Therefore, when searching for a document or case file it is often necessary to visit both the ROD and The Rooms to view their collections.
",-1,,
298,"As my focus broadens and more individuals who took part in the affairs of the Colony in the early days become associated with my area of research additional documents will no doubt take on new meaning and will be included here.
",-1,,
299,"I am presenting these documents in chronological order, as I did for the documents of the Central District, as there is no “theme” or other order suggested by the contents of the files and an alphabetical listing would have to list the documents at least twice, once by the name of the Plaintiff and once by the name of the Defendant, and more than twice in the instance of multiple Plaintiffs and Defendants.
",-1,,
300,"Many of the files presented here are of no relevance other than to indicate that a familiar name appeared on the list of petty or grand jury members in a particular sitting of the Court.
",-1,,
301,"Other files are simply summary tables to the cases heard during that session or circuit of the court, focusing for my purposes on the sessions that took place in Ferryland rather than elsewhere in the Southern District.
",-1,,
302,"All of these files were photographed, not scanned, and, where there were multiple pages in a case file, each page is presented as a separate photograph.
",-1,,
303,"As noted above, some of the pages in these court registers were devoted to summarising the cases being heard in the sessions of a particular period in time, sometimes in one year, sometimes in multiple years.
",-1,,
304,"This is the closest thing to an index that exists for the contents of these registers and unfortunately they have never been digitised by The Rooms and made available as such.

310,"The defendants admitted and paid the debt, leaving one to wonder why they did not do so before going to the trouble and expense of a hearing before the court.
",-1,,
311,"It is of interest nevertheless because it shows how closely allied in business Benjamin Sweetland and Matthew Morry (Junior) were at this time.
",-1,,
312,"The first case was withdrawn and settled out of court, again begging the question why these things even appeared in court in the first place.
",-1,,
313,"The second case is similar in that the Plaintiffs charged they had supplied the Defendant and his servants bait worth £10-10 Shillings, the Defendant admitted the debt and was ordered to pay the full amount.",-1,,

",-1,,
315,"This is an extremely important case for my family history research because it pertains to proven charge of rape against one of my ancestors.

316,"It is even more notable because of the light treatment this pillar of society received when found guilty by a jury of his peers, including amongst others Benjamin Sweetland as foreman and Nicholas Stabb, Matthew Morry (junior one assumes), Peter Winser, Ewen Stabb, and Noah Clift, all men with whom Carter was related either through marriage or business or both.
",-1,,
317,"Another unusual aspect of the case is that the charge was being laid not as a criminal offence but rather as a civil case seeking compensation by the mother of the girl raped to cover the loss of her services whilst pregnant and later whilst caring for her child.
",-1,,
318,"No criminal charges were evidently laid in the case and the judge and jury, though finding Carter liable, restricted that liability to £30 instead of the £100 sought in the action.",-1,,
319,"We know from information found in other sources on the case that the girl who was raped, Ellen Delahunty, was forced by public censure to leave the village but we do not know what became of her or her child, except that Carter never admitted any responsibility for their care.
",-1,,
320,"As far as is known, the incident did not cause anything more than a little public embarrassment to Carter and possibly not even that.
",-1,,
321,"This case has been written up in several legal journals because of the lengthy explanation offered by the trial judge on a matter that, at least on the face of it, seemed simple and presumably one that would not take much of the court’s time.
",-1,,
322,"All that lesser mortals need to know about this case is that Ewen Stabb carried fish for Peter Winser to England and that upon arrival the fish weighed much less than when shipped because of the condition of the fish when shipped (it had not been properly dried before being shipped).
",-1,,
323,"Winser refused to pay the full freight claiming a mistake had been made in the weighing of the cargo and that he should only have paid freight on the amount received, not the amount shipped.
",-1,,
324,"But the judge determined that this was not the case according to legal precedent and that Stabb was indeed entitled to receive the full price agreed in advance for his shipping the fish and ought not to be forced to return any part of that commission to Winser.
",-1,,
325,"Curiously, this page contains two lists of writs for Ferryland, the first undated but containing some of the cases mentioned above under 1827, but also many more not found in the register, and a second list said to be for 1828 which does not contain the cases heard below.",-1,,

330,"in this case, of whom there were at least three alive at this time, was Robert Carter RN.
",-1,,
331,"In the first case, Robert and James Carter, who were business partners as well as brothers, were attempting to recover a debt from Matthew Ryan but, as we learned above, he and his partner, Doran had been declared insolvent, hence the jury left it to Judge to determine how to deal with the situation and no conclusion is recorded.
",-1,,
332,"As in the case above where the table was ostensibly for 1828 but appeared to cover cases heard in 1827, this table is clearly meant to be the table for 1828 and not 1829 as it includes the two cases summarised above.",-1,,
333,"It appears therefore that the tables are out of place in the court records leading to a misunderstanding as to which year they apply, since not every page in the summaries is dated.

",-1,,
383,"This article is all about heads up poker online, and we have a feeling you are going to enjoy this!
",-1,,
384,"Read through the following section for a quick and clear explanation of what is heads up poker, as well as all the relevant information you need to learn how to play heads up poker to win.
",-1,,
385,"This kind of game setup is really exciting and very simple to learn, as you’re about to see.
",-1,,
386,"Heads up poker online is really popular right now, and you may just find it will quickly become one of your favorite online poker games of all time!
",-1,,
387,"What is heads up poker and why should you care?
",-1,,
388,"This type of scenario will happen naturally at the end of any poker tournament, when only two players are left on the table.
",-1,,
389,"In some cases you may find straight heads up poker games available at your favorite online poker room, where all sessions involve only two players.
",-1,,
390,"The reason why heads up poker is so exciting is because for the most part it removes luck out of the equation.
",-1,,
391,"Whereas in a typical poker game involving many players, there is only so far you can go in terms of predicting outcomes and hands… when only two players are involved, the game instantly gets much more cerebral and deliberate, since there are fewer variables involved and each player has only one opponent to focus on.
To become really strong in a heads up poker scenario, you have to develop a particular skill set that is different from what is needed to win at a sit&go table where you consistently face a group of players.
",-1,,
392,"Since in a heads up poker situation you are in the blinds in each and every hand, this means you have to be consistently very aggressive and keep pressuring your opponent.
",-1,,
393,"It takes nerves of steel and strong presence of mind to be able to throw your opponent around with every move you make, but that is your only option asides from being pushed around.
",-1,,
394,"Since this type of game typically involves high stakes and furious pacing, the rewards can be plentiful if you know what you’re doing and develop a winning strategy.
",-1,,
395,"Learn how to play heads up poker right here and now!
",-1,,
396,"The first thing you have to keep in mind to stay at the top of this confrontation is to keep yourself from getting blinded out!
",-1,,
397,"You do this by throwing your weight around in full force whenever you see an opening, which means you have to be very sharp and very aggressive.
",-1,,
398,"As far as hand probabilities go, you need to keep in mind that most often a game of heads up poker will go to the player holding the highest card or pair, since typically there will be fewer hands played out – which means there is a lower probability of either player hitting one of the highest poker hand rankings.
",-1,,
399,"Since heads up poker games invariably unfold quickly and aggressively, and because there is less room for unpredictable developments, these games are typically settled in just a few intense hands.
",-1,,
400,"This invariably boils down to the face value of the cards you’re holding, rather than the potential to put together a stronger hand as the game unfolds.
",-1,,
401,"Holding any Ace will instantly put your winning odds slightly over 50%, while having A-K will instantly push your winnings odds over 90%!",-1,,
402,"The key to learn how to play heads up poker to win is thus to understand the probabilities and potential of your pocket cards, and playing aggressively whenever the odds are leaning strongly in your favor.

404,"There's no people who are in my life once had no desire to have a dog.
",-1,,
405,"Additionally, God forbids envy (""...the feeling of displeasure produced by witnessing or hearing of the advan tage or prosperity of others; this evil sense always attaches to this word envy desires to deprive another of what he has, jealousy desires to have the same or the same sort of thing for itself.",-1,,
406,"(Note that envy denies that the Lord is good.)
",-1,,
407,"For a woman, it means she must be content with what God provides her under her proper authority.
",-1,,
408,"Our responsibility is to fit within the framework wherein we were born, for God chose our parents, station and social status in life.
",-1,,
409,"The responsibility of the girl and her parents is to see that the one she marries is properly established under God and proper authority.
",-1,,
410,"Consequently, the girl and boy have different lessons to learn in the home: among many other things, the boy must learn to be in Godly authority and ""self-sufficient,"" but the girl must learn to be under Godly authority.
",-1,,
411,"""
When and if she does seek to be ""self-sufficient,"" she leaves herself open to devastating deception.
",-1,,
412,"A widow or orphan, on the other hand, is under the Lord's authority, which is why He makes special provision for them in the Law.
",-1,,
413,"Note in these passages that only the fatherless and widow are promised protection directly from the Lord.
",-1,,
414,"If a woman says, ""I want more than God provides for me under my proper authority, so I am going to work in order to obtain more regardless of what anyone says,"" she has yielded to covetousness: she has turned to idolatry.
",-1,,
415,"Certainly, it is not wrong to desire more than we have; the sin is the willingness to compromise God's word and will to gain more.
",-1,,
416,"Nor is it wrong to work; the sin is when a woman or man ""works"" apart from proper authority.
",-1,,
417,"Note that it is the attitude involved pursuing ""things"" that creates the difficulty.
",-1,,
418,"A man's work is sin if he works apart from God's authority.
",-1,,
419,"This is why it is so important that both the girl and the girl's parents thoroughly examine a young man's attitude toward money and authority, e.g., Authority: 1 Samuel 15:23, Money: Luke 12:15, Ephesians 5:3.",-1,,
420,"The Lord does not take covetousness lightly, Colossians 3:5,...covetousness, which is idolatry...",-1,,
421,"God determined who would be born a girl and who would be born a boy.
",-1,,
422,"The enemy of all godliness is the one who perverted God's order.
",-1,,
423,"If the prospective husband is not properly submitted under God's authority and proper human authority (parents, &c.), marriage with him will only develop grave and complicated problems.
",-1,,
424,"If her dad saw that the man was not a proper man, he could, and probably should, forbid the marriage.
",-1,,
425,"The conclusion to the whole matter is that the primary lesson for any young person to learn is correct submission and response to all authority.
",-1,,
426,"Even though Divine Providence may leave a lady ""on her own,"" e.g., orphan or widow, Scripturally, she is primarily responsible to learn how to correctly be under proper authority, not how to make her own way through this world.
",-1,,
427,"On the other hand, the young man must learn how to be the proper authority and ""on his own"" under God.
",-1,,
428,"Sad to say, many times good, well-meaning parents urge their daughters to violate the clear teaching of God's word and be ""on their own"" and ""self-sufficient.",-1,,
429,"That the word of God be not blasphemed: as for the discharge of their duty towards God, so for the credit and reputation of the gospel, that for their carriage contrary to the rules of nature and morality, as well as of religion, the gospel may not be evil spoken of, as if from that they had learned their ill and indecent behaviour.
",-1,,
430,"We live in a society that has been very effectively ""secularized:"" the practical applications of God's Word have been almost totally removed and replaced by humanistic, man-centered thinking.
",-1,,
431,"This is particularly important when we consider that we must prepare a new generation of young people to face the difficult times ahead in what appears to be a developing pagan society.
",-1,,
432,"Are we going to raise a generation that trusteth in man or a generation that trusteth in the Lord?
",-1,,
433,"If Christians actually believe what they claim, they will act upon and according to the Word of God regardless of what surrounding society thinks, says &/or does.
",-1,,
434,"I suppose my heart is toward the daughters in a family because we only have daughters.
",-1,,
435,"When we train up girls to be self-sufficient, we do it to our own destruction and to the destruction of society.
",-1,,
436,"Thus when Christian young people are trained contrary to the Word of God, we can fully expect society in general to blaspheme God.
",-1,,
437,"One of our men said that his grandfather told him that he, the grandfather, said at the start of WW II when women went into the factory, ""This is the end of America.",-1,,
438,"Then He created woman to be man's helpmeet.
",-1,,
439,"Observe submitting themselves to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
",-1,,
440,"When a single young lady enters into the work place, she must submit herself to the authority other than her father's, and when a married woman enters the work place, she must submit to authority other than her own husband's .
",-1,,
441,"Moreover, those who ""hire"" her to be under their authority are guilty of bringing reproach upon the Word of God.
",-1,,
442,"If Paul meant what he told Timothy and Titus, and if we are not allowed to do evil that good may come of it, (Romans 3:8) where does this leave Christian ministries, churches and Christian Schools?",-1,,
443,"Are we willing to live by His law-word when the cost of such living is more than we planned, and brings hardship?
",-1,,
444,"Primarily, young ladies are to be taught proper submission to Godly authority, not how to be self-sufficient.
",-1,,
445,"Sadly, because young men are not trained in the home to be Godly, responsible men, women are being forced into self-sufficiency.
",-1,,
446,"Therefore, training that does not fit within the Spirit's general guidelines trains daughters to blaspheme the word of God.
",-1,,
447,"Paul clearly tells Titus how young ladies are to be trained.
",-1,,
448,"Our point is this: Godly Christian parents, even with the encouragement of Godly pastors, are pressuring young ladies to leave home and become self-sufficient, e.g., ""It's time to go to college and learn a `trade,' &c.""",-1,,
449,"Obviously, all young ladies who go ""on their own"" from the pressure of their parents will not go to the devil.
",-1,,
450,"But why tempt the Lord?
",-1,,
451,"Why give an occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully?
(1 Tim.
5:14.)",-1,,
452,"As they get older, parents may be inclined to continue treating them as 12 year olds with the same restrictions and demands.",-1,,
453,"As they get older, they must have more freedom.
",-1,,
454,"Single young people, especially a young lady, must always have boundaries in order to feel securethat is the way the Lord made us, e.g., this is the way, walk ye in it.
",-1,,
455,"Thus when she is urged or even forced out on her own, she establishes her own boundaries, and the word of God is blasphemed.
",-1,,
456,"Second, she is told in words &/or attitudes that it is time to move out.
",-1,,
457,"Thus when daughters are told, ""You are this age, it's time to move out,"" they are being forced into something they are not equipped by God to handle.
",-1,,
458,"Certainly, there are Godly single women who have remained so in order to serve the Lord.
",-1,,
459,"""
As mentioned above, our corrupt society in which men refuse to be men many times forces young ladies into ""self-sufficient"" situations.
",-1,,
460,"If they are forced into such situations, that is a different story, but they should still be well-prepared to know what to expect, to remain close to the Lord and to be responsive to proper authority.
",-1,,
461,"Fathers (& mothers) may use many reasons to excuse molding their daughters into women who can fit into the ""working"" world, but they will be hard pressed to justify their actions from the Word of God.

462,Paul did not say that the Spirit's command in Titus 2 is only in effect until the twentieth century.,-1,,

464,"Though Bible believing Christians and pastors may be loudly proclaiming the shame of women taking on obviously unBiblical, antiChristian roles in society, the ""Women's Lib"" movement appears to be gaining great strength.

465,"Thas God speaks clearly against several things in Deut 22:5: 1) women in the military; 2) women in occupations that are generally associated with men, and 3) women who are indistinguishable from men in their dress.",-1,,
466,"When dress is the primary distinction between the sexes, then woman are forbidden to wear men's apparel.
",-1,,
467,"Obviously, Romans 2 refers to circumcision, but the point is this many who boast of their love for the Word of God are dishonoring God by causing the name of God to be blasphemed in their families and in their churches.",-1,,
468,"Christians cannot condemn the unGodly for blaspheming God when their own actions contrary to the Word of God are what causes the word of God to be blasphemed by the unGodly.
",-1,,
469,"An honest and just social order is built upon honest and just family relationships, which must start at the very foundation of marriage.
",-1,,
470,"God considers it very important that the man and woman contemplating marriage be open and honest with one another.
",-1,,
471,"First, we see that God protects a woman from deceitful intentions of a man.
",-1,,
472,"The desires which led to his taking her as his wife were not pure, v. 13.",-1,,
473,"In order to do this, he brings charges against her concerning her purity before their marriage.
",-1,,
474,"These were serious charges which would result in her death if proved true, v.21.",-1,,
475,"Second, we see that God protects a man from deceitful intentions of a woman, vv.
20, 21.",-1,,
476,"For whatever reason, the woman deceived her prospective husband into thinking she was pure.
",-1,,
477,"He finds out on their wedding night that he was deceived.
",-1,,
478,"The law permits the husband to go to the elders of the city, who act as the judges in the matter, and charge his new wife with not being pure, v. 14.",-1,,
479,"If the evidence proves his daughter is innocent of the charge by her husband, then the husband is chastised for bringing the false charge, fined 100 shekels of silver, and the husband is deprived of any future divorce right.",-1,,
480,"Furthermore, the husband's forfeits his right to divorce, which in practicality, he became her slave.
",-1,,
481,"On the other hand, if it is determined that the woman did intentionally deceive the man before their marriage, God's law requires her death, vv.
20, 21.",-1,,
482,"Notice that the woman is not put to death for impurity before marriage (cf.
",-1,,
483,"The Lord forbids people from passing themselves off as something they are not.
",-1,,
484,"This requirement does not require opening up every detail of one's past life to the other unless ignorance of that detail could damage the marriage relationship.
",-1,,
485,"We are told very little about his past life, only what is needful, but he never passes himself off as something that he is not.
",-1,,
486,"Second, if the damsel is not betrothed or married, AND the maid is a virgin, the guilty man had to pay the father 50 shekels of silver (about 3 years wages), the dowry of a virgin.",-1,,
487,"On the other hand, if the maid is not a virgin, the man does not have to pay the dowry.
",-1,,
488,"There are other laws which come into action if the woman is playing the harlot, which we will not look at now.
",-1,,
489,"Let us not think for a moment that the enemy of our souls doesn't know that if he can cause men to lose their self-control and moral fiber, he has gained society.
",-1,,
490,"Much of what we see around us today is geared for the breakdown: Pornography, advertising, TV, and entertainment of all kinds, & c.
Obviously, the law of vv.
22-29 applies equally to woman, but the responsibility before God falls squarely upon the man.",-1,,
491,"Foruth, if the father does not permit the marriage, the dowry is paid anyway, which gives her a double dowry upon marriage, making her an attractive prospective bride.
",-1,,
492,"The immoral action was an attack against the family, robbing the father of what was his, a virgin daughter.
",-1,,
493,"Fifth, this law also assumes that the man is not an incorrigible person (habitual offender), who was severely dealt with, Deuteronomy 21:18-21.",-1,,
494,"Finally, it is impossible for one of these laws to stand alone.
",-1,,
495,"We are living in a society where men refuse to take responsibility for anything, especially their own emotions and passions.
",-1,,
496,"But God holds them responsible, and their society will reflect what they are in the heart.
",-1,,
497,"Those who deny the clear teaching of the word of God claim that each man has enough good within him that with enough education in the facts of a matter, he will make the right decision.
",-1,,
498,"However, Paul quotes Psalms 14, telling us that such an assumption is contrary to the Word of God.",-1,,
