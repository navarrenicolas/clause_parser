0,"Prince George, B.C.- Construction of the new RiverBend Seniors housing project in Prince George is well underway, but it’s a project that almost didn’t happen.
"
2,"He says it wasn’t until Mayor Lyn Hall was elected that the wheels were set in motion.
"
5,"She and her husband are among those who have already purchased a unit and expect to move to their new condo in the fall of 2017.
"
6,"“We were at the point of knowing we would need to move, but didn’t want to move into any of the existing facilities in Prince George.”"
7,"Norheim was a teacher at the Connaught Junior High School which was on the neighbouring property until it burned to the ground.
"
8,“In all my years of teaching I never imagined I would be living in its backyard.”
9,"She is also pleased their little dog, a small poodle terrier mix, will be able to live with them.
"
10,"Quinn says they did make an interesting discovery when they started construction, “The creek ran right through the property.
"
11,"Even though we had done our geo-tech work, we had no idea until we got into the ground how much of a challenge that was going to be for an excavation.”"
12,"But he says their past experience in dealing with alpine construction and avalanche trenches gave them the know-how to deal with it.
"
15,"If the NDP was in power (god forbid) and it was NDP MLA’s in the picture, you would be the first to be all over it, praising them and the NDP to no end!!
"
16,"Go ahead and deny it if you want, but we know better!
"
17,What we do know with the liberals is they are always raising fees and medical costs for retired seniors..and also charging them more every year for staying in senior housing..
21,"Let us say that the last little bit will be taken care of in 20 years from now.
"
22,"As time progresses, there will be progressively more money available to spend on parks, to spend on no tax increase for a few years until inflation starts catching up, and so on.
"
23,"We will then buy new buildings, additions, infrastructure, enhancements of one sort or other, rebuilding old stock, etc.
at 2036 dollars which will have 20 years inflation on them.
"
24,"EXCEPT, we cannot do that until we have saved for these new buildings and other infrastructure so we can see such development 40 years from now.
"
26,"Good understanding of how the operation of a City works and how financing city development works.
"
28,"Learn to design them so that they are as natural as possible.
"
30,"That is the way to design low maintenance “parks”.
"
32,"Just like they have forgotten about Cottonwood Island Park and the Heritage Riverfront Trail system.
"
33,"Yess the owners of the condos can save money too if they tap into the creek that runs underneath.
"
34,"I see we really do not give a chit about housing for seniors, do we???
"
36,"I could be wrong but what is wrong with keeping more seniors in Prince George?
Nothing, just the usual curmudgeons that believe every project is a personal assault on their lives, all change is bad and anytime you even see a politician it must be a self serving photo-op.
"
37,"What is great about a project that only got built due to all the corporate welfare that it received?
"
39,"The mayor and council of this city should put a sign that reads “For Sale…cheap” outside of council Chambers.
"
41,"Remember, the City does not collect any income tax.
"
44,"Anything BC Housing has been getting into in the recent past reeks of Provincial Government download of responsibility without the necessary transfer of funds to the City.
"
47,"Seems that demand for these units is already there!
"
48,"I for one have parents who are in their very golden years.
"
49,"A facility like this, especially next door to Gateway, will be well utilized and much appreciated by those that will live there and by those who will be able to easily visit elderly family members who will choose to stay here instead of moving south!
"
50,"Sounds like a win for those that will live there, those who’s family will live there, those who will work there and those who will benefit from the economic activity generated from the retirement funds that will be spent here instead of in the Okanagan or other points down south!
"
51,"What is so special about being close to Gateway?
Are they in the market for cars, mufflers, tires, motel room rentals?
"
54,"The Gateway might be a clean-look route to drive through, but it is not exactly a shopping, restaurant or entertainment mecca.
"
55,"Come to think of it, which part of PG is, other than parts of downtown plus the major shopping centres.
"
56,"1?
What about all the other projects that developers walk away from, because the city is truly not ‘open for business’.
Change the archaic zoning bylaws.
"
59,"As an example do you think that a 10 year tax break, along with $265,000.00 in development cost charges relief, plus the $855,000.00 affordable housing grant is a little excessive.
"
60,"Who will own the rental units when the project is completed.
"
61,"My understanding is that the Government will own 33 units and Oncore Seniors Society, received financing from the Government over a long period of time, and they will own the other 33 units.
"
64,"My understanding is that these rental units will be available for low to moderate income seniors.
"
66,"Where does one go to get on the waiting list.
"
67,"These are one bedroom units with a space for a micro wave (Not provided) and while some aspects of it are pretty good, in actual fact, we end up with putting all this money into a project and end up with 33 units.
Hmmmm.
"
68,"Perhaps gopg2015 could do some of his research and come up with a dollar number for the cost per unit, and perhaps some inkling as to how one can access these rentals.
"
70,"Palopu, your comment shows us the amount of homework and research you did to support your assertions… my thumbs up!
"
71,"There is insufficient information to come up with a cost per unit.
"
75,"What I am really trying to get at is why should anyone in the public have to do such calculations?
"
78,"In this case they and the province need to prepare a prospectus of the project, the amount of subsidies provided by the taxpayer to something which few us will see any direct benefits from, the benefits which will accrue to the general population, who will be the source of the majority of the funds, and which services we will not see for general application to our annual budget deliberations, and so forth.
"
79,"I think THAT is the message we need to keep hammering the City as well as the province with.
"
81,"This looks like its going to be a successfull project with obvious demand for the units.
"
82,"How come it took a company from Kamloops to make this happen?
"
83,"The developers in PG seem to be very risk adverse and lack the vision and capasity to grow this city to its potential.
"
84,"This is one of those statements that could actually be very good or very bad .
.
.
"
86,"There needs to be a reporting out to the citizens of PG of the actual cost to the City of the subsidy provided and the measurable value received in return stated both in quality and in monetary quantity..
Like to get the names of the voters who voted for A.
The Harper Conservatives B.
The BC Liberals.

404,"But I believe we are numb, anesthetized to just how prevalent this is.
"
406,"Perhaps it’s time you did.
"
407,"Why?
"
408,"Because, ideas that journey past the outer ear do impact you and me in real and tangible ways.
"
409,"Until and unless we notice this, our senses will dull, as will our thinking and our capacity to act with a clear and discerning mind.
"
410,"Whether the radius of your world is measured by the distance between where you stand and the nearest traffic sign, or some spot on the other side of the globe, what you hear, see and feel generate perspectives and creative capacities that are then walked into and called “reality”.
"
411,"Our perspectives perpetuate to such an extent that we no longer view them as perspectives – rather, we begin to view them as truths.
"
412,"Every so often we should stop, look, listen and take stock of the subtle ideas we are being fed by others.
"
413,"Then we ought take action, including owning up to past perspectives that were mistaken or held in error.
"
415,"At some point in our lives we started tuning in to what our thinking was actually being barraged by.
"
416,"We listened to a talking head, or watched a video, e.g.
The Secret, and latched onto the notion that, as my old teacher used to say, “To Think Is To Create.”"
418,"But in the doing so, we rarely discipline ourselves to attend (i.e.
pay attention) to the radio or TV, or the images in ads, or the political spin masters as they weave paragraphs laden with doublespeak and shoddy premised foundations.
"
420,"If for no other reason than this a meditation practice is important.
"
421,"Whether you consider yourself an ardent student or just a dabbler in this regard, you probably have a degree of understanding that outside thought and suggestion affects your grey matter.
"
423,"But, just because our technologies (computers, google & Yahoo, twitter, etc.)
add seeming ease to life does not relieve us of the responsibility and accountability to guard the thinking mind.
"
424,"Advertisers know that subtle shifts in image and tone affects the buying public.
"
425,"News media (TV, radio, print, online) know that the pictures and words that confront you will color your perspective.
"
426,"CNN will show you one image of a smiling politician, while FOX News shows a growling image of the same politician (and vice versa) … both images used to report the identical event but shaping a different story.
"
427,"Why?
Because it’s not the news they are selling, it’s something else.
"
429,"Then why so much money spent monthly on political campaigns after the elections are over?
--- and on advertising the reason you should buy a certain burger, attend a particular brand name church this weekend, scent to your skin with this one oh sooo good and chug that brew at the party?
Case in point: almost every politician says, “I’m against negative campaigning!”"
431,"How come?
"
434,"Like a frog in the proverbial water-slowly-coming-to-boil we’ve been swimming in “it’s just the way things are” and we no longer recognize the water is there, let alone the temperature rising.
"
435,"Kind of like smelling foot odor as the tennis shoes come off after a game.
"
438,"And another: I’ve lost count of the times I’ve heard radio talk show hosts rant and rave about a particular injustice, only break away for ads that promotes the very injustice or notion the host is hammering against.
"
439,"What’s going on?
Show business, that’s what.
"
440,"Many of us (or the companies that employ our time and talents) have spent sizeable amounts on workshops, courses, lectures, videos, books and audio programs calling us to our attend to our thinking.
"
441,"But what practices do we put in place and return to on a regular basis for our well being after the course or seminar or lecture is over?
"
442,"For the sake of clarity, I’m not necessarily addressing wellbeing as physical health and wealth, though wellbeing in those domains is important.
"
444,"So, with the above as background grist, here’s an exercise (or practice) to engage in for the next 30 days, with full knowledge that something will come your way to distract you from hanging in there with this.
"
445,"If you are willing to take on this simple exercise, I recommend you give it a fair shot for the full 30-day duration.
"
446,"(4) a willingness to pay attention to what is going on around you: the conversations; the TV; the songs, ads and talk on radio; the pictures, symbols and words in print and internet medium strung together to convince of a point of view OR worse yet something that some one say YOU NEED, that you didn’t know beforehand that YOU NEEDED!
"
447,"It doesn’t matter if these come in the form of advertisement, political commentary (regardless the brand name of the espousing political party), religious conviction (no matter the brand name of the espousing church), etc.
"
449,"What does matter is: (1) pay attention, (2) take note, and (3) ask at least these three questions: “What is being said, fed, sold or told?”"
450,“Why this?”
451,"“Who, besides myself, stands to benefit if I am convinced or agree with what I am hearing and/or what is being implied?”"
453,"Look at what you record.
"
458,"You might even catch yourself talking to the radio or TV, “Heck, I didn’t know I needed that.”"
460,"Return to the list of names that opened this article, particularly Napoleon Hill.
"
462,"He didn’t invent what he wrote about, he reported on it.
"
463,"As I recall, and I’m willing to be wrong, he promoted the idea of SERVICE, and that this (service) was the result of FINDING something that OTHERS (not self) TRULY NEED"
464,"and then HONESTLY going about FILLING THAT NEED so that those OTHERS would and could BENEFIT.
"
465,"I don’t recall him writing that service resulted from creating or inventing an imagined need and then convincing others that the thing created was in fact something that had to be filled so that the person who imagined it could benefit.
"
467,"But, this I will say – it is disturbing just how many programs, products and so-called “services” exist today that say they are based on Hill’s work and yet they operate with darn near the sole intent of filling their own need.
"
468,"And here I’m including some that exist in my field of the human potential, leadership education and team effectiveness.
"
469,"Self-help spun in a different direction, i.e.
which “self” are we talking about being helped?
"
471,"I don’t think anyone needs to do it.
"
474,"I honestly believe it will be enlightening, ear and eye opening, especially if preconceptions and past certainties are set aside.

494,"They lived in the Piedmont region of Virginia, which was a hotbed of revivalism and a part of what we now call the Second Great Awakening.

496,"So, when any modern leaders, like Governor Jindal, assert that America needs a new spiritual awakening, they are the ones in touch with our nation’s history---not the modern intelligentsia that views the religious right as interlopers to an otherwise blissful secular state.

543,"When we study the Bible, we are on a quest for meaning — and not just any meaning, but God’s meaning through the Bible’s human authors.
"
546,"To conduct one, search for a particular word throughout the Bible to help clarify meaning and make connections to other Scriptures.

Arcing provides a way of preserving what we’ve seen with a kind of drawing of the text, each statement having an arc and each relationship having a symbol.

"
552,"We talk this way all the time, especially when we’re trying to be clear and trying to explain something to somebody.
"
556,"What arcing does is force us to think about what we’re doing, and what the biblical writers are doing, just as a way of making sure that we don’t miss anything that they’re trying to show us.
"
557,"The great value of arcing is, mainly, it forces us to just look and look and look at the text and think and think about it.
"
558,"Paul said in 2 Timothy 2:7, “Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding.”"
559,"In order to get the fullest meaning out of a passage, we have to look at it carefully and in detail and think about it.

"
568,"As mentioned in the introduction to Newfoundland Court Records, The documents prepared for the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, whether for its central trial division in St. John’s or its circuit courts in the Southern District (Ferryland) and Northern District (Bonavista), have wound up being separated in two archival collections nowadays.
"
574,"Therefore, when searching for a document or case file it is often necessary to visit both the ROD and The Rooms to view their collections.
"
579,"As my focus broadens and more individuals who took part in the affairs of the Colony in the early days become associated with my area of research additional documents will no doubt take on new meaning and will be included here.
"
580,"I am presenting these documents in chronological order, as I did for the documents of the Central District, as there is no “theme” or other order suggested by the contents of the files and an alphabetical listing would have to list the documents at least twice, once by the name of the Plaintiff and once by the name of the Defendant, and more than twice in the instance of multiple Plaintiffs and Defendants.
"
582,"Many of the files presented here are of no relevance other than to indicate that a familiar name appeared on the list of petty or grand jury members in a particular sitting of the Court.
"
583,"Other files are simply summary tables to the cases heard during that session or circuit of the court, focusing for my purposes on the sessions that took place in Ferryland rather than elsewhere in the Southern District.
"
584,"All of these files were photographed, not scanned, and, where there were multiple pages in a case file, each page is presented as a separate photograph.
"
586,"As noted above, some of the pages in these court registers were devoted to summarising the cases being heard in the sessions of a particular period in time, sometimes in one year, sometimes in multiple years.
"
587,"This is the closest thing to an index that exists for the contents of these registers and unfortunately they have never been digitised by The Rooms and made available as such.
"
593,"In this instance, Robert Carter was the Deputy Sheriff, William Carter was the Magistrate, and Richard Sullivan and Michael Devereaux and a person named Sisk whose forename was omitted were amongst the petty jurors.
"
594,"Meanwhile a list of those required to attend as members of grand juror but who did not attend (most likely occupied in the fishery) was given and each was threatened with a fine £2-10 Shillings, should they not appear during the session, a hefty price to pay for a weeks absence from the fishery.
"
595,"Their excuses were heard and some were absolved while others were made to pay.
"
597,"Matthew Morry Jr. was owed rent for a fishing room that he owned in Aquaforte (this is news to me).
"
599,"The trustee handling their affairs promised Matthew £15 out of the £16 he was owed but then recanted and said there were insufficient funds available to pay even 20 Shillings on the Pound.
"
602,"The defendants admitted and paid the debt, leaving one to wonder why they did not do so before going to the trouble and expense of a hearing before the court.
"
603,"It is of interest nevertheless because it shows how closely allied in business Benjamin Sweetland and Matthew Morry (Junior) were at this time.
"
606,"The first case was withdrawn and settled out of court, again begging the question why these things even appeared in court in the first place.
"
607,"The second case is similar in that the Plaintiffs charged they had supplied the Defendant and his servants bait worth £10-10 Shillings, the Defendant admitted the debt and was ordered to pay the full amount.
"
609,"Obviously, from the cases presented below, which do not appear in this list, it was incomplete.
"
613,"This is an extremely important case for my family history research because it pertains to proven charge of rape against one of my ancestors.
"
614,"It is even more notable because of the light treatment this pillar of society received when found guilty by a jury of his peers, including amongst others Benjamin Sweetland as foreman and Nicholas Stabb, Matthew Morry (junior one assumes), Peter Winser, Ewen Stabb, and Noah Clift, all men with whom Carter was related either through marriage or business or both.
"
615,"Another unusual aspect of the case is that the charge was being laid not as a criminal offence but rather as a civil case seeking compensation by the mother of the girl raped to cover the loss of her services whilst pregnant and later whilst caring for her child.
"
616,"No criminal charges were evidently laid in the case and the judge and jury, though finding Carter liable, restricted that liability to £30 instead of the £100 sought in the action.
"
617,"We know from information found in other sources on the case that the girl who was raped, Ellen Delahunty, was forced by public censure to leave the village but we do not know what became of her or her child, except that Carter never admitted any responsibility for their care.
"
618,"As far as is known, the incident did not cause anything more than a little public embarrassment to Carter and possibly not even that.
"
620,"This case has been written up in several legal journals because of the lengthy explanation offered by the trial judge on a matter that, at least on the face of it, seemed simple and presumably one that would not take much of the court’s time.
"
622,"All that lesser mortals need to know about this case is that Ewen Stabb carried fish for Peter Winser to England and that upon arrival the fish weighed much less than when shipped because of the condition of the fish when shipped (it had not been properly dried before being shipped).
"
623,"Winser refused to pay the full freight claiming a mistake had been made in the weighing of the cargo and that he should only have paid freight on the amount received, not the amount shipped.
"
624,"But the judge determined that this was not the case according to legal precedent and that Stabb was indeed entitled to receive the full price agreed in advance for his shipping the fish and ought not to be forced to return any part of that commission to Winser.
"
625,"Curiously, this page contains two lists of writs for Ferryland, the first undated but containing some of the cases mentioned above under 1827, but also many more not found in the register, and a second list said to be for 1828 which does not contain the cases heard below.
"
627,"But the inaccuracies pertaining to listings by year which do not contain cases found in the register is perplexing.
"
628,"I find these summary tables to be less useful than I initially thought that they would be in terms of location cases of interest.
"
629,"Amongst the Officers of the Court in this session, William Carter is named as a “Justice of the Peace” and not a “Magistrate”, as was customarily the case.
"
630,"It isn’t clear if this had any meaning in law at the time.
"
634,"in this case, of whom there were at least three alive at this time, was Robert Carter RN.
"
637,"In the first case, Robert and James Carter, who were business partners as well as brothers, were attempting to recover a debt from Matthew Ryan but, as we learned above, he and his partner, Doran had been declared insolvent, hence the jury left it to Judge to determine how to deal with the situation and no conclusion is recorded.
"
640,"As in the case above where the table was ostensibly for 1828 but appeared to cover cases heard in 1827, this table is clearly meant to be the table for 1828 and not 1829 as it includes the two cases summarised above.
"
641,"It appears therefore that the tables are out of place in the court records leading to a misunderstanding as to which year they apply, since not every page in the summaries is dated.
"
642,"The same Officers of the Court in this session were chosen as in 1828, with William Carter named once again as a “Justice of the Peace” and not a “Magistrate”.
"
644,"The names of the Grand Jury are not given suggesting there was no need for a jury in this session.
"
646,"This summary may or may not be for 1830 since it does not contain the cases outlined below.
"
647,"It may in fact be the summary table for 1829 during which year no cases were found to be of interest to my research.
"
649,"This seems odd until one reads the Grand Jury presentment below, in which William Carter is chastised for creating a nuisance with the placement of his new house.
"
652,"The names of the Grand Jury are again not given suggesting there was no need for a jury in this session.
"
655,"They also express concern that cases of a petty nature that could be handled in another venue are taking them from their normal work for days on end.
"
657,"I presume this is the new house we hear of in the Journal of Robert Carter.
"
658,"They are concerned that the Public Coroner must travel great distances in his capacity as Clerk of the Circuit Court and hence be absent when needed in Ferryland.
"
659,"Finally they conclude that the Clerk of the Peace should be on salary and not receive fees for his services when acting as Clerk of the Circuit Court and that the Clerk of the Peace not be obliged to serve in this capacity in any event as it too results in lengthy absences from his duties in Ferryland.
"
661,"Michael was not a merchant and it was some measure of the esteem in which he was held, nevertheless, that he was named as the foreman of a jury.
"
662,"Although he pleaded guilty and was found so by the Judge, strangely the Prosecutor intervened on his behalf and thus he was only fined 1 Shilling.
"
663,"One supposes that Henry Coryear may have shared some part of the blame for the assault on his person.

664,"It seems that Michael Costello systematically took the salmon out of everyone’s nets moored to Ferryland Head, not just those of Robert and James H. Carter.

"
668,"Just yesterday, while writing about how chicken heads saved Switzerland from rabid foxes, there was a sudden flash in my mind and I recalled having seen Destin’s video (I don’t know how that happened.

670,"I’ve attached it below for you to see.
"
671,"In the video, Destin demonstrates how chickens have an amazing ability which enables them to keep their heads perfectly stable.
"
672,"It is just one of the many ways birds are better than humans.
"
673,"Irrespective of how their body moves, their head remains perfectly still in a way that their eyes are able to see a very stabilized image.
"
674,"It is interesting to note that it isn’t just chickens who have this ability.
"
677,"Most vertebrates have this device inherently built into their inner ears which has three tubes (probably to detect movement in all three dimensions).
"
679,"This is what it looks like.
"
681,"These three tubes are filled with a fluid which moves around when the head moves.
"
682,"As the fluid moves, it pushes something called a cupula and converts mechanical movement into an electrical signal.
"
685,"That is how your eyes are involuntarily able to stay focussed at a single point even when you move your hear.
"
687,"Using the same amazing biological image stabilization technology that was at his disposal, a youtuber decided to tie a camera to the chicken’s head to make a steady headcam.

"
698,"Materials and devices constructed at the micro- and nano-scales can circumvent many of the limitations of currently available technologies, allowing us to not only interface with tissue more densely – increasing both spatial resolution and dimensionality – but also to take advantage of the increased biocompatibility and decreased material stiffness as minimum implanted feature sizes shrink.

"
736,"This article is all about heads up poker online, and we have a feeling you are going to enjoy this!
"
737,"Read through the following section for a quick and clear explanation of what is heads up poker, as well as all the relevant information you need to learn how to play heads up poker to win.
"
738,"This kind of game setup is really exciting and very simple to learn, as you’re about to see.
"
739,"Heads up poker online is really popular right now, and you may just find it will quickly become one of your favorite online poker games of all time!
"
740,"What is heads up poker and why should you care?
"
742,"This type of scenario will happen naturally at the end of any poker tournament, when only two players are left on the table.
"
743,"In some cases you may find straight heads up poker games available at your favorite online poker room, where all sessions involve only two players.
"
744,"The reason why heads up poker is so exciting is because for the most part it removes luck out of the equation.
"
745,"Whereas in a typical poker game involving many players, there is only so far you can go in terms of predicting outcomes and hands… when only two players are involved, the game instantly gets much more cerebral and deliberate, since there are fewer variables involved and each player has only one opponent to focus on.
To become really strong in a heads up poker scenario, you have to develop a particular skill set that is different from what is needed to win at a sit&go table where you consistently face a group of players.
"
746,"Since in a heads up poker situation you are in the blinds in each and every hand, this means you have to be consistently very aggressive and keep pressuring your opponent.
"
747,"It takes nerves of steel and strong presence of mind to be able to throw your opponent around with every move you make, but that is your only option asides from being pushed around.
"
748,"Since this type of game typically involves high stakes and furious pacing, the rewards can be plentiful if you know what you’re doing and develop a winning strategy.
"
749,"Learn how to play heads up poker right here and now!
"
751,"The first thing you have to keep in mind to stay at the top of this confrontation is to keep yourself from getting blinded out!
"
752,"You do this by throwing your weight around in full force whenever you see an opening, which means you have to be very sharp and very aggressive.
"
754,"As far as hand probabilities go, you need to keep in mind that most often a game of heads up poker will go to the player holding the highest card or pair, since typically there will be fewer hands played out – which means there is a lower probability of either player hitting one of the highest poker hand rankings.
"
755,"Since heads up poker games invariably unfold quickly and aggressively, and because there is less room for unpredictable developments, these games are typically settled in just a few intense hands.
"
757,"This invariably boils down to the face value of the cards you’re holding, rather than the potential to put together a stronger hand as the game unfolds.
"
759,"Holding any Ace will instantly put your winning odds slightly over 50%, while having A-K will instantly push your winnings odds over 90%!
"
760,"The key to learn how to play heads up poker to win is thus to understand the probabilities and potential of your pocket cards, and playing aggressively whenever the odds are leaning strongly in your favor.

765,"There's no people who are in my life once had no desire to have a dog.
"
769,"Additionally, God forbids envy (""...the feeling of displeasure produced by witnessing or hearing of the advan tage or prosperity of others; this evil sense always attaches to this word envy desires to deprive another of what he has, jealousy desires to have the same or the same sort of thing for itself."
772,"(Note that envy denies that the Lord is good.)
"
775,"For a woman, it means she must be content with what God provides her under her proper authority.
"
777,"Our responsibility is to fit within the framework wherein we were born, for God chose our parents, station and social status in life.
"
779,"The responsibility of the girl and her parents is to see that the one she marries is properly established under God and proper authority.
"
780,"Consequently, the girl and boy have different lessons to learn in the home: among many other things, the boy must learn to be in Godly authority and ""self-sufficient,"" but the girl must learn to be under Godly authority.
"
782,"""
When and if she does seek to be ""self-sufficient,"" she leaves herself open to devastating deception.
"
784,"A widow or orphan, on the other hand, is under the Lord's authority, which is why He makes special provision for them in the Law.
"
787,"Note in these passages that only the fatherless and widow are promised protection directly from the Lord.
"
789,"If a woman says, ""I want more than God provides for me under my proper authority, so I am going to work in order to obtain more regardless of what anyone says,"" she has yielded to covetousness: she has turned to idolatry.
"
790,"Certainly, it is not wrong to desire more than we have; the sin is the willingness to compromise God's word and will to gain more.
"
791,"Nor is it wrong to work; the sin is when a woman or man ""works"" apart from proper authority.
"
792,"Note that it is the attitude involved pursuing ""things"" that creates the difficulty.
"
795,"A man's work is sin if he works apart from God's authority.
"
797,"This is why it is so important that both the girl and the girl's parents thoroughly examine a young man's attitude toward money and authority, e.g., Authority: 1 Samuel 15:23, Money: Luke 12:15, Ephesians 5:3.
"
798,"The Lord does not take covetousness lightly, Colossians 3:5,...covetousness, which is idolatry...
"
801,"God determined who would be born a girl and who would be born a boy.
"
803,"The enemy of all godliness is the one who perverted God's order.
"
804,"If the prospective husband is not properly submitted under God's authority and proper human authority (parents, &c.), marriage with him will only develop grave and complicated problems.
"
807,"If her dad saw that the man was not a proper man, he could, and probably should, forbid the marriage.
"
809,"The conclusion to the whole matter is that the primary lesson for any young person to learn is correct submission and response to all authority.
"
810,"Even though Divine Providence may leave a lady ""on her own,"" e.g., orphan or widow, Scripturally, she is primarily responsible to learn how to correctly be under proper authority, not how to make her own way through this world.
"
811,"On the other hand, the young man must learn how to be the proper authority and ""on his own"" under God.
"
812,"Sad to say, many times good, well-meaning parents urge their daughters to violate the clear teaching of God's word and be ""on their own"" and ""self-sufficient."
815,"That the word of God be not blasphemed: as for the discharge of their duty towards God, so for the credit and reputation of the gospel, that for their carriage contrary to the rules of nature and morality, as well as of religion, the gospel may not be evil spoken of, as if from that they had learned their ill and indecent behaviour.
"
816,"We live in a society that has been very effectively ""secularized:"" the practical applications of God's Word have been almost totally removed and replaced by humanistic, man-centered thinking.
"
818,"This is particularly important when we consider that we must prepare a new generation of young people to face the difficult times ahead in what appears to be a developing pagan society.
"
819,"Are we going to raise a generation that trusteth in man or a generation that trusteth in the Lord?
"
820,"If Christians actually believe what they claim, they will act upon and according to the Word of God regardless of what surrounding society thinks, says &/or does.
"
823,"I suppose my heart is toward the daughters in a family because we only have daughters.
"
825,"When we train up girls to be self-sufficient, we do it to our own destruction and to the destruction of society.
"
828,"Thus when Christian young people are trained contrary to the Word of God, we can fully expect society in general to blaspheme God.
"
831,"One of our men said that his grandfather told him that he, the grandfather, said at the start of WW II when women went into the factory, ""This is the end of America."
834,"Then He created woman to be man's helpmeet.
"
838,"Observe submitting themselves to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
"
839,"When a single young lady enters into the work place, she must submit herself to the authority other than her father's, and when a married woman enters the work place, she must submit to authority other than her own husband's .
"
841,"Moreover, those who ""hire"" her to be under their authority are guilty of bringing reproach upon the Word of God.
"
842,"If Paul meant what he told Timothy and Titus, and if we are not allowed to do evil that good may come of it, (Romans 3:8) where does this leave Christian ministries, churches and Christian Schools?
"
844,"Are we willing to live by His law-word when the cost of such living is more than we planned, and brings hardship?
"
849,"Primarily, young ladies are to be taught proper submission to Godly authority, not how to be self-sufficient.
"
850,"Sadly, because young men are not trained in the home to be Godly, responsible men, women are being forced into self-sufficiency.
"
852,"Therefore, training that does not fit within the Spirit's general guidelines trains daughters to blaspheme the word of God.
"
853,"Paul clearly tells Titus how young ladies are to be trained.
"
854,"Our point is this: Godly Christian parents, even with the encouragement of Godly pastors, are pressuring young ladies to leave home and become self-sufficient, e.g., ""It's time to go to college and learn a `trade,' &c."""
855,"Obviously, all young ladies who go ""on their own"" from the pressure of their parents will not go to the devil.
"
856,"But why tempt the Lord?
"
857,"Why give an occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully?
(1 Tim.
5:14.)
"
861,"As they get older, parents may be inclined to continue treating them as 12 year olds with the same restrictions and demands.
"
862,"As they get older, they must have more freedom.
"
865,"Single young people, especially a young lady, must always have boundaries in order to feel securethat is the way the Lord made us, e.g., this is the way, walk ye in it.
"
866,"Thus when she is urged or even forced out on her own, she establishes her own boundaries, and the word of God is blasphemed.
"
867,"Second, she is told in words &/or attitudes that it is time to move out.
"
870,"Thus when daughters are told, ""You are this age, it's time to move out,"" they are being forced into something they are not equipped by God to handle.
"
871,"Certainly, there are Godly single women who have remained so in order to serve the Lord.
"
874,"""
As mentioned above, our corrupt society in which men refuse to be men many times forces young ladies into ""self-sufficient"" situations.
"
875,"If they are forced into such situations, that is a different story, but they should still be well-prepared to know what to expect, to remain close to the Lord and to be responsive to proper authority.
"
876,"Fathers (& mothers) may use many reasons to excuse molding their daughters into women who can fit into the ""working"" world, but they will be hard pressed to justify their actions from the Word of God.
"
877,"Paul did not say that the Spirit's command in Titus 2 is only in effect until the twentieth century.
"
878,"Recently, the media proclaimed the glories of 500 women going on the Aircraft Carrier Eisenhower where 6,000 men are stationed (pregnancy, said the ship's captain, is no more of a problem than a broken leg.
Abortion?).
"
880,"Though Bible believing Christians and pastors may be loudly proclaiming the shame of women taking on obviously unBiblical, antiChristian roles in society, the ""Women's Lib"" movement appears to be gaining great strength.
"
882,"Thas God speaks clearly against several things in Deut 22:5: 1) women in the military; 2) women in occupations that are generally associated with men, and 3) women who are indistinguishable from men in their dress.
"
883,"When dress is the primary distinction between the sexes, then woman are forbidden to wear men's apparel.
"
884,"Obviously, Romans 2 refers to circumcision, but the point is this many who boast of their love for the Word of God are dishonoring God by causing the name of God to be blasphemed in their families and in their churches.
"
885,"Christians cannot condemn the unGodly for blaspheming God when their own actions contrary to the Word of God are what causes the word of God to be blasphemed by the unGodly.
"
896,"An honest and just social order is built upon honest and just family relationships, which must start at the very foundation of marriage.
"
897,"God considers it very important that the man and woman contemplating marriage be open and honest with one another.
"
900,"First, we see that God protects a woman from deceitful intentions of a man.
"
901,"The desires which led to his taking her as his wife were not pure, v. 13.
"
904,"In order to do this, he brings charges against her concerning her purity before their marriage.
"
905,"These were serious charges which would result in her death if proved true, v.21.
"
907,"Second, we see that God protects a man from deceitful intentions of a woman, vv.
20, 21.
"
908,"For whatever reason, the woman deceived her prospective husband into thinking she was pure.
"
909,"He finds out on their wedding night that he was deceived.
"
911,"The law permits the husband to go to the elders of the city, who act as the judges in the matter, and charge his new wife with not being pure, v. 14.
"
914,"If the evidence proves his daughter is innocent of the charge by her husband, then the husband is chastised for bringing the false charge, fined 100 shekels of silver, and the husband is deprived of any future divorce right.
"
918,"Furthermore, the husband's forfeits his right to divorce, which in practicality, he became her slave.
"
920,"On the other hand, if it is determined that the woman did intentionally deceive the man before their marriage, God's law requires her death, vv.
20, 21.
"
921,"Notice that the woman is not put to death for impurity before marriage (cf.
"
926,"The Lord forbids people from passing themselves off as something they are not.
"
927,"This requirement does not require opening up every detail of one's past life to the other unless ignorance of that detail could damage the marriage relationship.
"
929,"We are told very little about his past life, only what is needful, but he never passes himself off as something that he is not.
"
935,"Second, if the damsel is not betrothed or married, AND the maid is a virgin, the guilty man had to pay the father 50 shekels of silver (about 3 years wages), the dowry of a virgin.
"
937,"On the other hand, if the maid is not a virgin, the man does not have to pay the dowry.
"
938,"There are other laws which come into action if the woman is playing the harlot, which we will not look at now.
"
941,"Let us not think for a moment that the enemy of our souls doesn't know that if he can cause men to lose their self-control and moral fiber, he has gained society.
"
942,"Much of what we see around us today is geared for the breakdown: Pornography, advertising, TV, and entertainment of all kinds, & c.
Obviously, the law of vv.
22-29 applies equally to woman, but the responsibility before God falls squarely upon the man.
"
945,"Foruth, if the father does not permit the marriage, the dowry is paid anyway, which gives her a double dowry upon marriage, making her an attractive prospective bride.
"
946,"The immoral action was an attack against the family, robbing the father of what was his, a virgin daughter.
"
949,"Fifth, this law also assumes that the man is not an incorrigible person (habitual offender), who was severely dealt with, Deuteronomy 21:18-21.
"
950,"Finally, it is impossible for one of these laws to stand alone.
"
952,"We are living in a society where men refuse to take responsibility for anything, especially their own emotions and passions.
"
953,"But God holds them responsible, and their society will reflect what they are in the heart.
"
955,"Those who deny the clear teaching of the word of God claim that each man has enough good within him that with enough education in the facts of a matter, he will make the right decision.
"
956,"However, Paul quotes Psalms 14, telling us that such an assumption is contrary to the Word of God.
