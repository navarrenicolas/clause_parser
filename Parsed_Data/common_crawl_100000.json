 {'sentence': In the first case, Robert and James Carter, who were business partners as well as brothers, were attempting to recover a debt from Matthew Ryan but, as we learned above, he and his partner, Doran had been declared insolvent, hence the jury left it to Judge to determine how to deal with the situation and no conclusion is recorded.,
